## Aims

- I want to start, shutdown and or reboot various Docker containers from within Home Assistant
- Using [Bubble Card](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card) for the interface would be good as it will fit with some of my other dashboards
- Reuse my existing Proxmox Control elements as possible!

## TL:DR

This article presents 

1. Docker-compose and Home Assistant configurations necessary to bring docker containers into Home Assistant as entities
2. A Home Assistant [script](./scripts/proxmox_lxc_control.yaml) that can be used to control (start, shutdown, or reboot) multiple Proxmox VE LXCs/VM
3. A Home Assistant [interface element](./interface_elements/proxmox_control_interface.yaml) that works with the script to control 4 different Proxmox VE LXCs

The interface buttons use Bubble Card to provide a single button for each Docker container including:

**UPDATE THIS**

- Status of the container (on/off/pending/rebooting)
- (if available) Container health
- A sub-button to toggle between on/off
- A sub-button to reboot
- Sub-button icons change color and change to a spinning 'working' icon during transitions

## Steps

1. Setup [Docker access](#Docker-access) within HA
2. [Provide feedback](#problem---button-presses-are-instantaneous) for button presses
3. Create the [Bubble Card Buttons](#bubble-card-styling)
4. Generate [single script to handle multiple conditions](#generate-single-script-to-handle-multiple-conditions) (start/shutdown/reboot)

## Docker Access

Home Assistant doesn't have a built in Docker integration, but there's a HACS customer integration that will do the job nicely.  The HACS integration is called [Custom Monitor Docker component for Home Assistant](https://github.com/ualex73/monitor_docker).  The Monitor Docker component allows you to monitor Docker and container statistics and turn on/orr containers.  It can connect to the Docker daemon locally or remotely.  

Full configuration instructions are contained within the repository.  For my specific installation I've chosen to use [Tecnativa's Docker Socket Proxy](https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy) rather than connecting directly to the docker socket.  I've chosen to do this mainly because I have multple machines running docker and HA isn't necessarily running on the same machine.

### Docker Access Setup 1 - Docker Socket Proxy

Full instructions are [on the Github here](https://github.com/Tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy).  I'm just presenting how I've done it for 1 machine. 

> [!WARNING]
>
> Never expose this container's port to a public network.  Only to an internal network necessary for the communication between the proxy and the service that is using it (Home Assistant in this case)
>
> Enabling `POST` access to the docker socket has some pretty huge security implications.  Do so at your own risk!

My docker compose is [here](./docker/docker-socket-proxy_compose_example.yml).  I've based this off a question in the [Monitor Docker Q&A](https://github.com/ualex73/monitor_docker#qa)

### Docker Access Setup 2 - Home Assistant Custom Monitor Component

I'm not going to go through adding HACS to Home Assistant - there are a million turorials already written.

**Monitor Docker** is in the main HACs repository, just seach for it and add it the same as you would any other integration.

Configuration of Monitor Docker is done in `configuration.yaml`, there isn't a UI for doing this.  My [sample configuration is here](./config_snippets/monitor_docker.yaml) but as usual, there's far more detail in the [ualex73's github](https://github.com/ualex73/monitor_docker)

For the purposes of my switches, I've only enabled controls for container `state`, `status` and `health` but there's many more that could be added to do other things

This then exposes the following entities:

- `button.<docker-host>_<container>_restart` 
- `sensor.<docker-host>_<container>`
- `sensor.<docker-host>_<container>_health`
- `sensor.<docker-host>_<container>_state`
- `sensor.<docker-host>_<container>_status`
- `switch.<docker-host>_<container>`

## Providing User Feedback

### Problem - Button presses are instantaneous

The Docker HA integration exposes buttons to reboot a container and a switch to toggle between On and Off.  However a button press is an instantaneous thing - you press it, a command is sent to the docker socket, but you don't get any feedback until seconds later when the status of the target eventually changes and feeds back to HA.  Additionally, the on/off toggle is instantaneous but it takes a finite amount of time for the docker container to react and start or shutdown.

The docker integration polls every 10 seconds (this is configurable), but that's not 10 seconds from when you trigger an action, so you the poll might occur 1 second, 10 seconds (or anything in between) after you trigger the action.  This can leave you guess whether the command has actually registerd properly or may give deceptive feedback if the poll happens before the container has reacted - neither are desirable outcomes.

  <summary>Solution</summary>

### Solution

I'm sure there better ways of doing this, but I'm going to take a very simple approach to this - If I wait for 30 seconds after triggring an action, that should be long enough to ensure a change of state has been triggered.  For this 30 seconds, I'll need to provide some form of feedback, but the spinning waiting icon that I first used in my Proxmox buttons should be sufficient for this.

## Bubble Card Styling

I spent a lot of time getting the controls to behave the way I wanted.  Key requirements were:

- 2 sub buttons
    - start / shutdown
    - reboot
- Container status displayed (e.g. Running / Not Running)
- Visual feedback when the state is changing
    - Change of color / icon as appropriate
    - Spinning wait icons (because it's about time I figured out how to do this!)

The end result (in a generic button) looks like this:

## Generate single script to handle multiple conditions

### Problem - Passing Fields to scripts

I need a script that runs when a button is pressed.  Looking at the flow above, for the container in question it would then start, shutdown, or reboot depending on which button is pressed and the current state of the continer.  
However, I don't want to create a new script for each scenario, and for each container.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

### Solution

[u/domwrap](https://www.reddit.com/user/domwrap/) kindly suggested the use of fields within the script. The full details are in the [Home Assistant documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/script), but in summary, as part of the action, variables can be passed along to a script so they become available within templates in that script.  To configure a script to accept variables using the UI, the variables can be added as fields in the script editor.

</details>

### Problem - Choosing which container to act on

I'm currently running > 40 docker containers across lots of different machines, but for the sake of this example, I'm going to concentrate on 2 containers - `rtl433` and `esphome`, both running on a server called `maggie`. I'd like to control all of them with this script.  How to get the single script acting correctly on each container.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

### Solution

All of the container's entities have a similar naming convention:  `<domain>.<server>_<container>`, so for example:

- `sensor.maggie_rtl433_health` is the health of my rtl433 container **(if it includes healthchecks)**
- `button.maggie_rtl433_restart` is the reboot button for the container
- `sensor.maggie_rtl433_state` is the state of the container e.g. `running` / `exited`
- `switch.maggie_rtl433` is an on/off switch for the container

so if the script has fields for:

- `server` (the docker instance that the container is running on)
- `container` (the name of the docker container)
- `action` (start, shutdown, or reboot)...

I can use the following templates:  **CONTINUE WORK FROM HERE**

- `value_template: "{{ action | lower == 'toggle' }}"` is true if action = `toggle` - substitute `reboot` if required
- `entity_id: "{{ 'binary_sensor.' + target + '_status' }}"` is the target entity status
- `value_template: "{{ states('binary_sensor.' + target + '_status') == 'on' }}"` is true if the target status is `on` - substitute `off` if required
- `entity_id: "{{ 'button.' + target + '_' + action }}"` is the target entity's button (for start, shutdown, or stop)

### Problem - Coping with multiple button presses - Part 1

I've got several Proxmox VM and I don't want to wait for an action to complete on one before I start an action on another (e.g. I want to shutdown 2 VMs)

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

### Solution

After going back to the Home Assistant docs, I was reminded about [Script Modes](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/script#script-modes).
The full details are in the documentation but in sumamary, scripts be run in 1 of 4 different modes:

- `single`: Do not start a new run.  Issue a warning
- `restart`: Start a new run after first stopping previous run
- `queued`: Start a new run after all previous runs complete.  Runs are guaranteed to execute in the order they were queued
- `parallel`: Start a new, independent run in parrallel with previous runs

For my use-case, `parallel` fits the best as I want to each button press to be treated independently

In yaml, it then looks like this:

```yaml
mode: parallel
max: 10
```

Note, the `max: 10` can be used to limit the number instances of the script that can be running at the same time

Alternatively, if you're making scripts in the user interface, the script mode can be set using the top-right menu:

![Script menu showing modes](./media/script_change_mode.png)

</details>

### Problem - Coping with multiple button presses - Part 2

Each VM has 2 buttons - one for start/shutdown and a 2nd button for reboot.  If I've pressed the button to reboot a machine, I don't want the start/shutdown to be triggered while the reboot is still in progress.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

### Solution

To solve this, I'll create an option within my script that will be triggered if the status of the VM being called is anything other than 'on' and 'off'.  The code snippet for this is shown below:

```yaml
- conditions:
  - condition: and
    conditions:
      - condition: template
        value_template: "{{ states('binary_sensor.' + target + '_status') != 'on' }}"
      - condition: template
        value_template: "{{ states('binary_sensor.' + target + '_status') != 'off' }}"
sequence: []
alias: If action is already in progress
```

</details>

## Result

### Script Flow

The script flow is shown below:

![Flow for Proxmox control script](./media/proxmox_control_script.png)

The full script is here:

[Script: Proxmox LXC Control](./scripts/proxmox_lxc_control.yaml)

This works with this set of buttons:
