# Proxmox Container and Virtual Machine Control

## Aims

- I'd want to start, shutdown and or reboot various Proxmox LXCs and VMs from within Home Assistant
- Using [bubblecard](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card) for the interface would be good as it will fit with other dashboards

## Steps

1. Setup Proxmox access within HA
2. Generate single script to handle multiple conditions (start/shutdown/reboot)
3. Style the bubblecard buttons

## Bubble Card Styling

Here's my list of [Bubblecard styling snippets](./bubblecard/bubblecard_styling_snippets.md).  The most relevant snippet for this example is [2 Rotating Sub-Buttons with color and icon change](./bubblecard/bubblecard_styling_snippets.md#2-rotating-sub-buttons-with-color-change)
